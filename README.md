Requirements:

- quick-to-join multiplayer game (trying https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus
  for this)
- no violence; school-appropriate
- quick-to-build code ~~using [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/)~~ (didn't
  figure this out; using vanilla skaffold)
- web-only (phone support is a plus)

Also using these:

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/en) - fast and compatible with npm
- skaffold
- rollup
- typescript
- [babylonjs](https://www.babylonjs.com/)

Actual game TBD.
