Requirements:
 - quick-to-join multiplayer game (trying https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus
   for this)
 - no violence; school-appropriate
 - quick-to-build code using [buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/)
 - web-only (phone support is a plus)

Trying [babylonjs](https://www.babylonjs.com/) again since it worked pretty well
on another project.

Actual game TBD.
